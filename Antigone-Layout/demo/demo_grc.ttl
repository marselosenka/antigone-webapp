# GLOBAL EXTRACTION RULES (MUST FOLLOW):
#
# 1 Ancient Greek is the canonical anchor.
#    - Canonical identifiers (:Scene, :Speech, :Line_###, :Character) are defined ONCE.
#
# 2 For translations (Modern Greek / English):
#    - DO NOT create or redefine any:
#        :Scene, :Speech, :Character, or canonical :Line_### individuals.
#    - ONLY create :TranslationVariant individuals (TV_*).
#    - Link each TranslationVariant to the canonical :Line_### using :relatedTo.
#
# 3 Do NOT invent structure.
#    - Reuse URIs exactly as given in the input.
#    - If a canonical URI is missing, skip it (do not guess).
#
# 4 Use ONLY classes and properties declared in the ontology (You are provided the Antigone-Ontology.ttl file)
#    - If no specific property exists, use :relatedTo or omit the assertion.
#
# 5 STRUCTURAL AUTHORITY RULE (extract if present, do not assume):
#    - You MAY extract Scene types (e.g., :Prologue, :Episode, :Stasimon, :Exodus),
#      line numbers, and canonical references ONLY when they are explicitly present
#      in the input image/text/metadata OR when they can be derived from explicit
#      rules provided in this prompt (e.g., a numbered transcription).
#    - If required information is missing, omit the corresponding triples rather than inventing them.
#  
#
# 6 No blank nodes. No duplicate individuals.
# If you seem to have conflicts/complications , mention them with at the end of the file with # REPORT and list them.

# 7 - VERSE SPLITTING POLICY:
# Even when verses are visually wrapped or merged in the source text,
# each canonical line number MUST be represented as a distinct :Line_### individual.
# Visual layout and metrical labels are non-authoritative.
# If a line appears to be split or merged, Mention it at the end of the file with # REPORT and list them. 


# MULTI-EXTRACTOR SAFETY RULES:
#
# - Each file is append-only.
# - Never redefine an individual already present in the input.
# - Canonical files (Ancient Greek) may define :Line_### once.
# - Translation files may define ONLY :TranslationVariant individuals.
# - Naming conventions:
#     Canonical lines: :Line_###
#     Modern Greek:   :TV_Line_###_ell
#     English:        :TV_Line_###_en
#
# - If a TranslationVariant already exists, do NOT recreate it.
# - If unsure, omit the assertion rather than inventing it.
#
# - At the end of output, include a short REPORT comment:
#     # REPORT: Produced TranslationVariants for lines X–Y. Skipped Z (missing anchors).
